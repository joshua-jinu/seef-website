                    Sustainable Environment Educational
                    Foundation (SEEF) was established in 2022
                    by alumni of St. Joseph's Boys' High School
                    (SJBHS) who had a vision to empower
                    today's youth to lead the way toward a
                    better and more sustainable future. SEEF’s
                    initial work revolved around developing and
                    implementing farm-based projects at a
                    model farm on the outskirts of Bangalore.
