# SEEF Foundation

Sustainable Environment Educational Foundation (SEEF) was established in 2022 by alumni of St. Joseph's Boys' High School (SJBHS) who had a vision to empower today's youth to lead the way toward a better and more sustainable future. SEEFâ€™s initial work revolved around developing and implementing farm-based projects at a model farm on the outskirts of Bangalore.
